                    <p class="post-text" style="padding-left: 30px;">1. Apply a small amount of product to the inside of your wrist.</p>
                    <p class="post-text" style="padding-left: 30px;">2. Leave on for at least 24 hours.</p>
                    <p class="post-text" style="padding-left: 30px;">3. If you haven’t experienced any irritation within a day, it should be safe to apply elsewhere.</p>

                    <p class="post-text">
                        If you do develop an allergic reaction, you may experience:

                    <h2 class="post-title">The bottom line</h2>
                    <p class="post-text">No herbal remedy can regrow a full head of hair. You should be wary of herbal products that claim to be a hair growth sensation.</p>
                    <p class="post-text">Research has shown that some herbs may help strengthen hair, support scalp health, improve hair thickness, or stimulate the hair growth cycle. Still, more clinical trials on humans are needed before herbal remedies become a mainstream hair growth treatment..</p>
                    <p class="post-text">Any herb may be used in all types of herbal hair product preparations. But it may be difficult to find over-the-counter hair growth products that include the herbs used in research. Your doctor or natural health practitioner may be able to help you find a remedy that best suits your needs.</p>
                    <p class="post-text">Be sure to talk with your doctor before use. They can walk you through your treatment options and advise you on any next steps.</p>
