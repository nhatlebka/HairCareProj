                    <h2 class="post-title">Overview</h2>
                    <p class="post-text">When you think of wrinkles, you may think of onabotulinumtoxin A (Botox), a common prescription medication that some people use to smooth wrinkles. But what about Botox for your hair?</p>
                    <p class="post-text">Hair on your head loses fullness and elasticity as it ages, just like your skin. New hair products market themselves as Botox for hair because they’re supposed to help fill the hair, make it smooth, and reduce frizz.</p>

                    <h2 class="post-title">Does Botox for hair contain Botox?</h2>
                    <p class="post-text">Botox for hair doesn’t actually contain the ingredient of botulinum toxin, which is the main ingredient of Botox. Instead, it’s a name based on how the product works. Just like Botox works by relaxing the muscles and smoothing skin, “hair Botox” works by filling in individual fibers of hair to help give it fullness and make it smooth.</p>

                    <h2 class="post-title">How does hair Botox work?</h2>
                    <p class="post-text">Hair Botox is actually a deep conditioning treatment that coats hair fibers with a filler, such as keratin. The treatment fills in any broken or thin areas on each hair strand to make hair appear more full and lustrous.</p>

                    <p class="post-text">
                        The ingredients differ depending on the product. L’Oreal Professional’s Fiberceutic uses an ingredient called Intra-Cylane to fill hair strands with flexible, soft fibers. That helps create the appearance of fuller, smoother hair. Another popular product, Majestic Hair Botox, claims to use a patented mix of:

                    <p class="post-text">
                        You can use Botox for hair if you have:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="post-list">
                        <li class="post-item">split ends</li>
                        <li class="post-item">very fine hair, lacking volume or luster</li>
                        <li class="post-item">damaged hair</li>
                        <li class="post-item">frizzy hair</li>
                        <li class="post-item">hair that you want straightened</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="post-text">In general, hair Botox is considered safe for any type of hair.</p>

                    <h2 class="post-title">Who can use Botox for hair?</h2>
                    <p class="post-text">Botox for your hair doesn’t use injections of any kind. Instead, it’s a conditioning agent that’s applied directly to your strands of hair. You can go to a hair salon to have the treatment or purchase the products to apply at home.</p>
                    <p class="post-text">The treatment begins with a shampoo to open your hair cuticles and prepare the strands for conditioning. The hair Botox is then applied to the strands by massaging the product on from root to tips. The treatment is left on wet hair for a period of time, usually between 20–90 minutes.</p>
                    <p class="post-text">Some stylists may choose to rinse out the product before drying and straightening your hair with a flat iron. Other stylists may leave the product on your hair while they dry and straighten your hair to help the product more fully penetrate your hair strands.</p>
                    <p class="post-text">You’ll see the results of the Botox hair treatment immediate upon your hair drying.</p>

                    <h2 class="post-title">How much does hair Botox cost?</h2>
                    <p class="post-text">The cost for Botox hair treatment ranges from around $150–$300 and upward, depending on if you purchase the ingredients to use at home or get the treatment done at a salon. Prices also vary by geographic location. If you’re having the treatment done at a salon, ask about price before you make your appointment.</p>

                    <h2 class="post-title">How effective is hair Botox?</h2>
                    <p class="post-text">Hair Botox is a popular trend right now, and there are many at-home versions that claim to be the real deal. It’s difficult to know how well these products work or if the ingredients are high-quality.</p>
                    <p class="post-text">Your best bet to get good results would be to visit a trusted salon and ask a hair stylist there for recommendations for the treatment. Hair stylists can purchase their products from verified sellers, so they know they’re getting the best products from trusted vendors.</p>
                    <p class="post-text">The effects of hair Botox are supposed to last between 2–4 months, although the exact time frame will vary from person to person. It’s recommended that you use a low-sulfate or sulfate-free shampoo to preserve the results.</p>

                    <h2 class="post-title">Hair Botox vs. keratin</h2>
                    <p class="post-text">Keratin treatments are chemical treatments that often contain formaldehyde. The formaldehyde is used to “lock” or “freeze” hair strands into a straight position to help keep them smooth. Although the formaldehyde used in these treatments has caused some concern because formaldehyde is a carcinogen, it does produce long-lasting results.</p>
                    <p class="post-text">Keratin hair treatments are typically a bit cheaper to purchase on your own. They cost between $70–$100, but may run upward of $150 or more in a salon.</p>
                    <p class="post-text">Hair Botox, on the other hand, is just a conditioning treatment and it doesn’t use chemical reactions to work. Botox hair treatment don’t contain any formaldehyde.</p>
                  
                    <h2 class="post-title">Takeaway</h2>
                    <p class="post-text">If you’re looking for a solution to smooth your hair and make it appear more full and lustrous, a Botox hair treatment can help. Be prepared to spend a couple hundred dollars and visit a trusted salon for the best results.</p>
