                    <h2 class="post-title">Overview</h2>

                    <p class="post-text">Sometimes, something as simple as not drinking enough water or washing your hair daily can be the culprit, though medical conditions like eczema or psoriasis could also be the cause.

                    <h2 class="post-title">1. Coconut oil</h2>

                    <h2 class="post-title">2. Tea tree oil</h2>
                    <p class="post-text">Tea tree oil has strong antiseptic, antifungal, and antibiotic propertiesTrusted Source that can relieve dry scalp and its symptoms. It’s why many dandruff shampoos can be found to have tea tree oil in them.</p>
                    <p class="post-text"><b>Where to buy?</b> Tea tree oil can be purchased as an essential oil from many drugstores, as well as online at retailers like Amazon.

                    <h2 class="post-title">3. Aloe vera</h2>

                    <h2 class="post-title">4. Apple cider vinegar</h2>
                    <p class="post-text">Apple cider vinegar has several great health benefits that can reduce symptoms of dry scalp.

                    <h2 class="post-title">5. Witch hazel</h2>
                    <p class="post-text">Witch hazel is often marketed in anti-itch products designed for dry and sensitive skin, and it’s historically been used in herbal medicine. It can be used to decrease inflammation that could be causing dry scalp from certain conditions. It also has powerful astringent properties that may soothe symptoms of dry scalp.</p>
                    <p class="post-text"><b>Where to buy?</b> It can be purchased on its own in a liquid form or be found in a number of soaps and lotions.</p>

                    <p class="post-text"><b>How to use</b>: Mash or blend a banana with a few tablespoons of coconut or olive oil. Blending it will make it easier to rinse out of your hair. Massage it into your scalp and let it sit for 10-15 minutes.</p>

                    <h2 class="post-title">8. Yogurt and egg</h2>
                    <p class="post-text">Though this may sound like a breakfast gone wrong, yogurt and eggs both have unique benefits that can relieve dry scalp. Yogurt is soothing on the skin and can also be exfoliating, while the fat and protein content in eggs can nourish and protect the scalp by preventingTrusted Source against free radical damage at the cellular level.</p>
                    <p class="post-text"><b>How to use: </b> Use a few tablespoons of plain, unflavored yogurt with no added sugar and mix in one well-beaten egg.

Rinse out the mixture with lukewarm or cold water, or the egg may cook and be much more difficult to remove from your hair.</p>

                    <h2 class="post-title">9. Jojoba oil</h2>
                    <p class="post-text">Like coconut oil, jojoba oil can be an effective moisturizerTrusted Source, which can relieve dry scalp quickly. It also has anti-inflammatory properties that may treat skin conditions affecting the scalp.</p>

                    <h2 class="post-title">10. Avocados</h2>
                    <p class="post-text">Avocados contain monounsaturated fatty acids and polyunsaturated fatty acids that can both moisturize and protect your skin. You can consume avocados (delicious!) and apply avocado or avocado oil topically to soothe dry scalp.</p>
                    <p class="post-text"><b>Where to buy?</b> You can grab avocados at your local grocery store or find avocado oil in stores and online.</p>
                    <p class="post-text"><b>How to use:</b> You can use both avocado oil or blended avocado topically to reduce dry scalp and its symptoms.

                    </p>
                    <p class="post-text">For an extra boost, you can blend both avocados and bananas together to use as a treatment.</p>

                    <h2 class="post-title">Risks and side effects</h2>
                    <p class="post-text">Treating dry scalp with these home remedies is generally considered safe and risk-free. Before using any new product, especially essential oils, you should do a test patch on the inside of your wrist to avoid an allergic reaction.</p>
                    <p class="post-text">It’s important to remember that essential oils aren’t monitored for purity or quality, so you should use caution when choosing a quality brand. These oils are also potent and should always be diluted with a carrier oil. In this case, using coconut or olive oil as a carrier oil could have added benefits for treating your scalp.</p>
                    <p class="post-text">Dry scalp can be bothersome, just alone for its visible effects on your hair and scalp. However, it can also lead to dandruff and visible hair loss. Hair loss may be due to persistent scratching.</p>
                    <p class="post-text">Some people will scratch enough that it causes soreness or even open wounds. If not cared for, these sores could become inflamed. In extreme cases, the sores (whether caused by scratching or infections) could result in scarring. If you believe you have any sores or wounds, you should see a doctor before applying any oils or home remedies as they may irritate the wound.</p>
                    <p class="post-text">In cases where dry scalp is caused by or associated with an infection — particularly a fungal infection — treatment is necessary to prevent it from spreading. You should see your doctor.</p>

                    <h2 class="post-title">Takeaway</h2>
                    <p class="post-text">Dry scalp can be uncomfortable, but fortunately it’s highly treatable. Many cases of dry scalp respond well to a change in your hair care products or routine, and home remedies can certainly help speed up the process.</p>
                    <p class="post-text">If home remedies haven’t started to work after two weeks, you can make an appointment to see your doctor to make sure there isn’t an underlying health condition that requires prescription treatment. If you notice that you’re experiencing hair loss along with dry scalp, particularly in conjunction with sores or blisters, it’s also a good idea to check in with your healthcare provider.</p>
