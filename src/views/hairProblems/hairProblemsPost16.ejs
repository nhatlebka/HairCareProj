                    <h2 class="post-title">How to treat hair falling out</h2>
                    <p class="post-text">According to the NHS, most forms of hair loss don’t need treatment. That’s because a lot of hair loss is either temporary or natural due to aging.</p>
                    <p class="post-text">However, you may need to be patient. It can take months for hair to start growing back and even longer for it to look somewhat “normal” again (whatever that means for you).</p>

                    <p class="post-text">That said, there are some approaches you can try to manage hair loss:</p>
                    <ul class="post-list">
                        <li class="post-item">Look after your general health if your hair loss is caused by your lifestyle. Try to ensure you’re eating a balanced diet with enough protein (usually at least 50 grams a day), vitamins, and minerals.</li>
                        <li class="post-item">If you want to embark on specific hair loss treatment, know that no remedy is 100 percent effective. Options include minoxidil (aka Rogaine), a medication that can help counteract hair loss and slow down the likes of pattern baldness. However, you have to use it every day in order for it to be effective – if you stop using it, your hair loss will resume.</li>
                        <li class="post-item">Try treating male pattern baldness with finasteride (Propecia), which reduces the DHT hormone for extra hair growth and less hair loss.</li>
                        <li class="post-item">Consider steroid injections or creams and ultraviolet (UV) light treatment, which may have positive effects.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="post-text">Remember: See a doctor if your hair is falling out in major clumps. They’ll be able to advise you of any effective treatment options.</p>

                    <h2 class="post-title">How to prevent hair falling out</h2>
                    <p class="post-text">Some forms of hair loss are hereditary or caused by illness, so there’s no foolproof way to prevent clumps from falling out.</p>
                    <p class="post-text">But there’s no harm in taking a look at your current lifestyle and making some changes if necessary.</p>
                    <p class="post-text">These changes could involve combating stress by exercising regularly or trying calming rituals, like yoga or meditation. You could also work on getting an adequate amount of sleep and enough nutrients by upping your fruit and vegetable intake.</p>
                    <p class="post-text">Try to treat your hair with care, too. Stay away from potentially aggravating ingredients, like alcohol, and drying heat tools.</p>

                    <h2 class="post-title">The bottom line</h2>
                    <p class="post-text">Losing clumps of hair can be particularly distressing. But there will always be an underlying reason, whether it’s a health condition, stress levels, or family genetics.</p>
                    <p class="post-text">The best person to help you find the cause is a doctor or specialist dermatologist.</p>
                    <p class="post-text">And remember: Most hair loss is temporary, and it will grow back eventually.</p>
