                    <p class="post-text">You can’t always prevent your hair from falling out as you age, but there are treatments and remedies that might slow down the process.</p>
                    <p class="post-text">Before you go out and buy supplements and special tonics, learn which ones have shown some promise in preventing or treating hair loss.</p>
                    <p class="post-text">Male pattern baldness, also known as androgenetic alopecia, is an inherited trait. It affects more than half of men over the age of 50.</p>
                    <p class="post-text">Here are 17 hair loss treatments you can talk to your doctor about:</p>

                    <h2 class="post-title">7 alternative remedies</h2>
                    <h4 class="post-category">9. Oils</h4>
                    <p class="post-text">
                        There’s some evidenceTrusted Source that peppermint oil can help with hair growth. Rosemary oil has also been traditionally used to increase blood circulation on the scalp.
                    </p>
                    <p class="post-text">A 2013 studyTrusted Source found that rosemary leaf extract improved hair regrowth in mice.</p>
                    <p class="post-text">Coconut oil, castor oil, and olive oil are also widely recommended, but research on their benefits for hair growth is limited.</p>

                    <h4 class="post-category">10. Saw palmetto</h4>
                    <p class="post-text">
                        Saw palmetto is a plant with small berries that’s often used as part of a treatment plan for an enlarged prostate.
                    </p>
                    <p class="post-text">While research is narrow on saw palmetto’s ability to treat hair loss, one study showed positive results for men treated with a topical formula.</p>

                    <h4 class="post-category">11. Biotin</h4>

                    <p class="post-text">Biotin is a vitamin found naturally in foods like:</p>
                    <ul class="post-list">
                        <li class="post-item">nuts</li>
                        <li class="post-item">sweet potatoes</li>
                        <li class="post-item">eggs</li>
                        <li class="post-item">onions</li>
                        <li class="post-item">oats</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="post-text">There’s some evidenceTrusted Source that taking biotin supplements by mouth may slow hair loss, but most of the research has been done in women.</p>

                    <h4 class="post-category">12. Onion juice</h4>
                    <p class="post-text">An older studyTrusted Source showed that the use of onion juice as a topical treatment resulted in significantly more regrowth than just tap water in people with patchy alopecia areata.</p>

                    <h4 class="post-category">13. Bhringraj</h4>
                    <p class="post-text">Bhringraj (Eclipta alba), also called false daisy, is a species in the sunflower family with a reputation in Ayurvedic tradition as an herb that supports hair growth.</p>
                    <p class="post-text">Studies in mice have shown that extracts of the herb do show better hair regrowth than minoxidil (Rogaine). However, more research is needed to confirm these effects in humans.</p>

                    <h4 class="post-category">14. Green tea</h4>
                    <p class="post-text">Another purported herbal remedy for hair loss is green tea.</p>
                    <p class="post-text">An older studyTrusted Source in mice on the polyphenolic compounds present in green tea showed promise as a natural remedy for hair loss, but human studies haven’t been done to confirm these effects.</p>

                    <h4 class="post-category">15. Hibiscus</h4>
                    <p class="post-text">Hibiscus rosa-sinesis is marketed widely in India for hair growth. One older study in miceTrusted Source showed positive effects on hair follicles, but no studies have been done in humans.</p>

                    <h4 class="post-category">16. Be gentle with your locks</h4>
                    <p class="post-text">
                        Try to be as gentle as possible when brushing or styling your hair. Constantly twisting, twirling, or pulling your hair tight can lead to hair loss.
                    </p>

                    <p class="post-text">If you’re worried about hair loss, you may want to avoid the following:</p>
                    <ul class="post-list">
                        <li class="post-item">tight hairstyles, such as pigtails, cornrows, braids, and buns</li>

                    </ul>
                    <p class="post-text">If you must use chemicals or bleach in your hair, seek help from a trained professional. Don’t try to do it yourself at home.</p>

                    <h2 class="post-title">One more tip and the bottom line</h2>
                    <h4 class="post-category">17. Stop or change a medication</h4>

                    <p class="post-text">Certain medications can lead to hair loss. Examples include:</p>
                    <ul class="post-list">
                        <li class="post-item">chemotherapy and radiation treatments</li>
                        <li class="post-item">blood thinners (anticoagulants)</li>

                        <li class="post-item">isotretinoin (Accutane), an acne treatment</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="post-text"><b>Remember:</b> If you’re concerned about your hair loss, don’t stop taking the medication right away. See your doctor to find out if you have other options. You might just have to wait until you finish your treatment. In most cases, your hair should return once the treatment is stopped.</p>
                    <p class="post-text">See your doctor if:</p>
