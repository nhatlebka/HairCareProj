                    <h2 class="post-title">Treatment for female pattern baldness</h2>
                    <p class="post-text">If you have female pattern baldness, you may be able to camouflage the hair loss at first by adopting a new hairstyle. Eventually, you might have too much thinning at the top of your scalp to hide.</p>
                    <p class="post-text">Early diagnosis is encouraged, as it can enable you to get on a treatment plan and potentially minimize future hair loss. Your treatment plan will likely consist of one or more medications approved to treat hair loss.</p>

                    <h4 class="post-category">Minoxidil</h4>
                    <p class="post-text">Minoxidil (Rogaine) is the only drug approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat female pattern baldness. It’s available in 2% or 5% formulas. If possible, opt for the 5% formula.</p>
                    <p class="post-text">To use, apply minoxidil to your scalp every day. Though it won’t fully restore all the hair you’ve lost, minoxidil can grow back a significant amount of hairTrusted Source and give your hair an overall thicker appearance.</p>
                    <p class="post-text">You probably won’t start to see results for 6 to 12 months. You’ll need to keep using minoxidil to maintain the effect, or it will stop working. If it stops working, your hair may return to its previous appearance.</p>

                    <p class="post-text">
                        The following side effects are possible:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="post-list">
                        <li class="post-item">redness</li>
                        <li class="post-item">dryness</li>
                        <li class="post-item">itching</li>
                        <li class="post-item">hair growth on areas where you didn’t want it, such as your cheeks</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4 class="post-category">Finasteride and dutasteride</h4>
                    <p class="post-text">Finasteride (Propecia) and dutasteride (Avodart) are FDA-approved to treat hair loss in men. They’re not approved for women, but some doctors do recommend them for female pattern baldness.</p>
                    <p class="post-text">Studies are mixed as to whether these drugs work in women, but some researchTrusted Source has shown that they do help regrow hair in female pattern baldness.</p>
                    <p class="post-text">Side effects can include headaches, hot flashes, and a decreased sex drive, especially during the first year of use. Women shouldn’t get pregnant while on this drug, because it can increase the risk for birth defects.</p>

                    <p class="post-text">
                        This drug can cause a number of side effects, including:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="post-list">
                        <li class="post-item">electrolyte imbalances</li>
                        <li class="post-item">fatigue</li>
                        <li class="post-item">spotting between periods</li>
                        <li class="post-item">irregular menstruation</li>
                        <li class="post-item">tender breasts</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="post-text">You may need to have regular blood pressure and electrolyte tests while you take this drug. If you’re pregnant or plan to become pregnant, you shouldn’t use this medication. Spironolactone may cause birth defects.</p>

                    <h4 class="post-category">Other options</h4>
                    <p class="post-text">If low iron is contributing to your hair loss, your doctor might prescribe an iron supplement. At this time, there isn’t any evidence that taking iron will regrow your hair. Other supplements, such as biotin and folic acid, are also promoted to thicken hair.</p>
                    <p class="post-text">One studyTrusted Source did show that women developed thicker hair after taking omega-3 fatty acids, omega-6 fatty acids, and antioxidants. However, it’s best to check with your doctor before taking any supplements to re-grow hair.</p>
                    <p class="post-text">Laser combs and helmets are FDA-approved to treat hair loss. They use light energy to stimulate hair regrowth. More research needs to be done to determine if this is truly effective.</p>
                    <p class="post-text">Platelet-rich plasma therapy may also be beneficial. This involves drawing your blood, spinning it down, then injecting your own platelets back into your scalp to stimulate hair growth. Though promising, more studies need to be done.</p>
                    <p class="post-text">You may be able to conceal hair loss by wearing a wig or using a spray hair product.</p>
                    <p class="post-text">A hair transplant is a more permanent solution. During this procedure, your doctor removes a thin strip of hair from one part of your scalp and implants it in an area where you’re missing hair. The graft regrows like your natural hair.</p>
                    

                    <h2 class="post-title">Is it reversible?</h2>
                    <p class="post-text">Female pattern baldness isn’t reversible. Proper treatment can stop the hair loss and potentially help regrow some of the hair you’ve already lost. Treatments can take up to 12 months to start working. You’ll need to stay on them long-term to keep from losing your hair again.</p>

                    <h2 class="post-title">Can you prevent female pattern baldness?</h2>
                    <p class="post-text">You can’t prevent female pattern baldness, but you can protect your hair from breakage and loss:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="post-list">
                        <li class="post-item">Eat a healthy diet. Get enough iron from foods like dark green leafy vegetables, beans, and fortified cereals.</li>
                        <li class="post-item">Avoid treatments that can break or damage your hair, such as straightening irons, bleach, and perms.</li>
                        <li class="post-item">Ask your doctor if any of the medicines you take can promote hair loss. If so, see if you can switch to another drug.</li>
                        <li class="post-item">Don’t smoke. It damages hair follicles and can speed up hair loss.</li>
                        <li class="post-item">Wear a hat when you go outside. Too much sun exposure can damage your hair.</li>
                    </ul>
